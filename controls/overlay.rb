         To mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive 
         information by entities that have been issued certificates 
         by CMS-approved PKIs, all CMS systems, including databases, 
         must be properly configured to implement access control 
         policies.

         Successful authentication must not automatically give an 
         entity access to an asset or security boundary. 
         Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented 
         to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated 
         and current authorization. Authorization is the process 
         of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is 
         permitted to access a specific asset. Information systems 
         use access control policies and enforcement mechanisms to 
         implement this requirement.

         Access control policies include identity-based policies, 
         role-based policies, and attribute-based policies. Access 
         enforcement mechanisms include access control lists, 
         access control matrices, and cryptography. These policies 
         and mechanisms must be employed by the application to 
         control access between users (or processes acting on behalf 
         of users) and objects (e.g., devices, files, records, 
         processes, programs, and domains) in the information system.

         This requirement is applicable to access control enforcement   
         applications, a category that includes database management 
         systems. If PostgreSQL does not follow applicable policy when 
         approving access, it may be in conflict with networks or other 
         applications in the information system. This may result in 
         users either gaining or being denied access inappropriately 
         and in conflict with applicable policy.'
